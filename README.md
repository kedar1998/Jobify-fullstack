## Reflection
In this application, I learned to connect frontend and backend. Also, I learned to communicate with backend from frontend. Learned Implemented authentication on backend so only register users can login and use the app. I got full experience for developing full stack app from scratch from designing to developing.

While building this application, I learned to handle errors and respont to them.
